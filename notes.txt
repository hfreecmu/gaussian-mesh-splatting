I generally do not know if this is better than the last AABF12 or dexycb commits.

I say this because some results on dexycb in previous trials were better. Although now I am not using splatting to update the object pose. So who knows.

This will require serious re-testing.

Things you changed (could be more, see commit):
- now not optimizing obj pose
- sdf changes (loss and how done)
- sdf detach (should obj be detached?)
- no more separate learned one hot mask, just setting to 1.0 and using splat opacities
- rgb and mask loss is different as it scales linearly
- no more hand scale
- background color opt?
- no more pose init



New commit:
    - changed clamp_scale_max to 3.0
    - changed hand_pose lr to self.hand_pose
    - added valid pix loss for human mask BUT not for ssim TODO fix that
    - modified sdf loss ranges
    - fixed rgb coeff to 1.0 and sdf loss fixed
    - changed how mask coeff was decreased
