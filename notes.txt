I generally do not know if this is better than the last AABF12 or dexycb commits.

I say this because some results on dexycb in previous trials were better. Although now I am not using splatting to update the object pose. So who knows.

This will require serious re-testing.

Things you changed (could be more, see commit):
- now not optimizing obj pose
- sdf changes (loss and how done)
- sdf detach (should obj be detached?)
- no more separate learned one hot mask, just setting to 1.0 and using splat opacities
- rgb and mask loss is different as it scales linearly
- no more hand scale
- background color opt?
